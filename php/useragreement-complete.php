            <h4> Introduction</h4>
            <p> You have been directed to this Acceptable Use Agreement for Access to Technology
                and Information Resources as a new or continuing faculty, staff, hourly, or affiliated
                employee at Indiana University. </p>
            <p> Access to Indiana University data and information, and access to IT accounts, systems,
                and applications, is based on your need for access and your assent to use that access
                appropriately. These services are integral to the operation of the university, and
                security and privacy laws and other institutional policies protect much of the information.</p>
            <p> Therefore, before you can be granted access, you must read and agree to follow these
                acceptable usage standards, and must accept responsibility to preserve the security
                and confidentiality of information that you access, in any form, including oral,
                print, or electronic formats. </p>
            <p> Read the information below carefully. It begins with an explanation of how data
                use is governed within IU, and then sets out user responsibilities. Although these
                general provisions apply to all IU information and IT accounts, systems, and applications,
                please be aware that managers of certain services or information types may require
                you to complete additional agreements and/or training. </p>

            <h4> Information Governance Explained</h4>
            <p> The university has assigned the following roles concerning data and information.</p>
            <p> <strong>Ownership:</strong> Indiana University is the owner of the university's
                institutional data and information.</p>
            <p> <strong>Data Stewards:</strong> These are senior university officials who have planning
                and policy-level stewardship responsibility for specific segments of the university's
                information resources (usually within functional areas). Data Stewards establish
                standard rules, guidelines, and profiles for information access, and also make recommendations
                and decisions about individual requests to access information. The responsibility
                for such recommendations may be delegated to a Data Manager.</p>
            <p> <strong>Data Managers:</strong> These are university officials and their employees
                who have operational-level responsibility for information management activities
                related to the access, capture, maintenance, and dissemination of data and information.</p>
            <a href="#top" class="pull-right">↑ top</a>
            <div class="clear"> </div>
            <a name="classification"></a>
            <h4> Information Classification Explained</h4>
            <p> Institutional Data is defined as a data or information element that satisfies one
                or more of the following criteria:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>it is relevant to planning, managing, operating, or auditing a major administrative
                    function of the university</li>
                <li>it is referenced or required for use by more than one organizational unit</li>
                <li>it is included in an official university administrative report; or</li>
                <li>it is used to derive an element that meets the criteria above</li>
            </ul>
            <p> Data Stewards apply the following criteria to classify institutional data and information
                into four levels:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Public</li>
                <li>University-internal</li>
                <li>Restricted</li>
                <li>Critical</li>
            </ul>
            <p> <strong>Public data</strong> is defined as data to which little to no restrictions
                apply. The general public may be granted access to such data.</p>
            <p> <strong>University-internal data</strong> is defined as data that may be accessed
                by all eligible employees of the university, without restriction, in the conduct
                of university business. This should be the "default" classification for all data.</p>
            <p> <strong>Restricted data</strong> may not be accessed without specific authorization,
                or only selective access may be granted because of legal, ethical, or other constraints.</p>
            <p> <strong>Critical data</strong> is defined as data by which inappropriate handling
                could result in criminal or civil penalties, identity theft, personal financial
                loss, invasion of privacy, and/or unauthorized access to this type of information
                by an individual or many individuals.</p>

            <a name="usage"></a>
            <h4> Usage Responsibilities</h4>
            <p> The following points detail your responsibilities as you access, use, or handle
                information or information technology (IT) at IU.</p>
            <a name="secure"></a>
            <h5> Secure Usage</h5>
            <p> You agree to:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Never share your account password(s) or passphrase(s), or SafeWord card
                    PIN, with anyone, including friends, roommates, family, or IU staff. </strong> </li>
                <li>Select strong password(s) and passphrase(s) and change them regularly. </li>
                <li>Be mindful that different computer systems and applications provide different levels
                    of protection for information, and seek advice on supplemental security measures,
                    if necessary. For example, a mobile laptop, tablet, or smartphone provides inherently less protection than
                    a desktop computer in a locked office. Therefore, the level of protection provided
                    to information accessed or stored using a laptop is to be supplemented by using
                    additional safeguards such as encryption technology, enhancing physical security,
                    restricting file permissions, etc. </li>
                <li>Respect the university's information and system security procedures (i.e., never
                    attempt to circumvent or "go around" security processes). </li>
                <li>Make appropriate use of the tools provided (e.g., strong passphrase, virus detection,
                    encryption software, encrypted transmission, training, etc.) to uphold the security
                    of the university's IT systems and applications, and the confidentiality of information
                    stored on them. </li>
                <li>Take steps to understand "phishing attacks," computer viruses, and other destructive
                    software, and take steps to protect your accounts from such threats (e.g., never
                    reply to emails asking for account passwords or passphrases, never open unsolicited
                    email attachments, never click unknown links, use virus scanning software, apply
                    system patches in a timely manner, etc.). </li>
                <li>Immediately notify your campus <a href="http://kb.iu.edu/data/abxl.html">Support
                    Center</a> if you believe your account credentials (e.g., user ID, password, passphrase,
                    SafeWord card PIN, etc.) have been compromised. </li>
                <li>Maintain information in a secure manner to prevent access, viewing, or printing
                    by unauthorized individuals.</li>
                <li>Secure unattended computers (e.g., log off, lock, or otherwise make inaccessible),
                    even if you will only be away from the computer for a moment. </li>
                <li>Store Restricted and Critical data securely (e.g., on secure servers, in locked
                    file cabinets, etc.).</li>
                <li>Securely dispose of Restricted and Critical information (e.g., by shredding, disk
                    wiping, physical destruction, etc.).</li>
                <li>Never copy and/or store Restricted or Critical data outside of institutional systems
                    (e.g., on desktop workstations, laptops, USB drives, personally owned computers,
                    etc.) without proper approval from the senior executive officer of the department
                    and only in cases where it is absolutely necessary for the operation of the department.</li>
                <li>Take appropriate steps to secure information (e.g., password protection, encryption,
                    etc.) on mobile devices (e.g., laptops, tablets, USB drives, smartphones, etc.). </li>
                <li>Ensure, in the rare cases where Critical data has been approved for use and storage
                    outside of institutional systems, that the data are appropriately encrypted, especially
                    on mobile devices (e.g., laptops, tablets, smartphones, USB drives, CD-ROMs). </li>
                <li>Ensure, in the rare cases where it is necessary to email Critical data, that the
                    data are sent to the correct recipient and only via encrypted email methods.</li>
            </ul>

            <h5>Legal Usage</h5>
            <p> You agree to:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Use information and IT for legal purposes only. </li>
                <li>Respect and comply with all copyrights and license agreements. </li>
